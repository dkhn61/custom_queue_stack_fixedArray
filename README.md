• Stack — an ADT that contains a list of elements such that the list has last-in, first-out (LIFO) 
semantics, i.e., elements are inserted into the front of the list and removed from the front of 
the list

• Queue — an ADT that contains a list of elements such that the list has first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
semantics, i.e., elements are inserted into the of the list and removed from the front of the list; 
and

• Fixed Array — an ADT that is an array, but cannot grow or shrink.

Each of the ADTs listed above is implemented using C++ templates. This will 
allow each ADT to work with arbitrary data types. The project is based on Composition i.e. Aggregation and Inheritance.
Stack and Queue classes are based on aggregation and the Fixed_Array and Array classes are inheriting from the base array class.
