# cs50700-fall2022-composition

The assigment is tested in Clion. Compiles fine in Clion.
But, It is giving compiler error in Visual Studio Code.
Tried placing all files into 1 directory, then also its having trouble with compilation and needs c++11 version update.


## COMMENT

You need to move all your files in subdirectories to the root directory
for this repo. Otherwise, the build system will have a hard time including
the header files for the ADTs.
